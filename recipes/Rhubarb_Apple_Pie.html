<h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h4>For the Pie Crust</h4>    
<ul>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, more as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar, optional</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (4-ounces) chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>4 to 6 tablespoons ice water</li>
        
        <h4>For the Rhubarb Custard Filling</h4>
        
        <li>2 cups diced fresh or frozen rhubarb</li>
        <li>1.5 cups diced apples (peeled)</li>
        <Li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</Li>
        <Li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</Li>
        <Li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</Li>
        <Li>1 pinch kosher salt</Li>
        <Li>2 large eggs</Li>
        <Li>2 tablespoons milk</Li>
        <Li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</Li>
        <Li>Fresh or store-bought whipped cream, for serving, optional</Li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar, if using. Whisk to blend thoroughly</li>
        <li>Add the butter, working it into the flour mixture with your fingers or a pastry blender. Some pea-sized pieces of butter should remain intact. </li>
        <li>Stir in 4 tablespoons of ice water. Add more ice water, about 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture begins to hold together.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and press until a smooth dough has formed. Do not overwork or the crust will be tough.</li>
        <li>Shape into a flattened disk. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 F. On a lightly floured work surface, or between sheets of lightly floured parchment, roll the dough into a circle about 11-inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate. Fold any excess dough over on itself and crimp the edge as desired.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss together the rhubarb, sugar, flour, nutmeg, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs with milk. Add the egg mixture to the rhubarb mixture, stirring until blended.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rhubarb mixture into the prepared pie crust. Dot with butter. Bake until set in the center, 45 to 55 minutes. If your crust begins to brown too much, cover the edges with foil.</li>
        <li>Remove the pie to a rack to cool completely before slicing.</li>
