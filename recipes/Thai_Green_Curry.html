<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>1 Eggplant</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp Green Curry Paste</li>
        <li>1 Can Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Fish Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Palm Sugar</li>
        <li>Thai Basil Leaves</li>
        <Li>Kaffir Lime Leaves</Li>
        <Li>1/2 Red Bell Pepper</Li>
        <Li>1 Yellow Onion</Li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a quarter of the can of coconut milk in the sauce pan or wok and let it simmer for a couple of minutes</li>
        <li>Add your curry paste and stir it into the coconut milk until it’s all mixed together.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer for at least 5 minutes until it becomes fragrant. The longer you leave it simmering the more flavoursome your curry will be! (This is the most important part of the recipe and many green curries end up tasting terrible because the curry paste isn’t left to simmer for long enough).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and stir it into the curry paste until all the chicken is covered.</li>
        <li>Add the remainder of the coconut milk and turn the heat up and bring it to the boil before reducing the heat again to let it simmer. Add the sugar and fish sauce. Stir and taste; adjust seasoning to preference.</li>
        <li>Add the eggplant first (as these take longer to cook)
            When it begins to boil again you can add the additional vegetables and kaffir lime leaves.
            Bring it to the boil once more and that’s it.</li>
    </ol>
